## Project Overview 

The Legacy Senior Communities is committed to providing a clean environment to all residents and guests. To achieve this goal, housekeeping checkups are performed. Currently, the process is completely manual, and no data is saved. 

This Housekeeping Quality Control Web App aims to convert manual, paper-based processes into an automated, digital experience to significantly increase the efficiency, accuracy, and organization of housekeeping QC processes at The Legacyâ€™s Midtown Park community in North Dallas.
