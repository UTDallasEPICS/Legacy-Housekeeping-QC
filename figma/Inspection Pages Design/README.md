# Introduction

Inside, you'll find detailed designs tailored for various screen sizes, including the iPhone 8, iPad Mini 8.3, and desktop. Inside each folder, you will see a PNG file labeled (1) that will contain the home view on the Inspection Page and contain a list of inspections remaining, and the PNG file labeled (2) contains the view of which inspection is to be made.

The design of (1) will allow you to search inspections by team member name, building name, floor number, etc. You can also create a new inspection using drop-down menus. The design of (2) will allow you to perform inspections based on a quantitative rubric. It includes a checklist of items, which you can remove or add freely. Please note that instead of checking unacceptable items, you check off acceptable items instead. To accommodate this change, it is planned that all items will be checked at the start. During inspection, you can also add comments, upload images, and add extra points.

# Notes

This design had not been updated for the current design, which also contain a date picker and adjustable checklist.
